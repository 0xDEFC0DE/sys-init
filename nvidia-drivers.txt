HOW CAN I INSTALL NVIDIA DRIVERS?

First we have to add 'contrib non-free' in /etc/apt/sources.list.
Read the file proprietary-wifi.txt to learn more.
Then we have to install the nvidia-detect utility

    # sudo apt install nvidia-detect

We now use this tool to detect the appropriate nvidia driver for
the card installed.

    # nvidia-detect

You can install the needed driver with apt get install or running the command

    # sudo apt install $(nvidia-detect | grep "It is recommended to install the" -A 1 | tail -n1)

If a pop up window in the terminal opens up, it's ok just press ok.
To easily monitor your gpu from the command line install nvidia-smi

    # sudo apt install nvidia-smi

Then reboot your machine
