To add a custom resolution the first step is to add the following lines
to /etc/X11/xorg.conf

	Section "Monitor"
		Identifier "<xrandr-output>"
		<output-of-cvt>
	EndSection

where the cvt command works as follows

	# cvt <width> <height> <refresh-rate>

this step will make the new resolution permanent.
If you want to use it as default, you can insert the following command
in yout .xinitrc file before running the window manager

	# xrandr --output <xrandr-output> --mode <your-new-mode>
