HOW TO FIX PROPRETARY WIFI DRIVERS

If you are like me, when you tried to run nmtui there was no wifi connection
available.
While you were installing debian, probably some message about missing firmware
pooped up at a given time.
Now is the moment to fix this issue.
To do so we have to add the contrib and non-free components.
Add, using your text editor of choice (by default debian comes with nano),
contrib non-free right after each line that ends with main
/etc/apt/sources.list.

	# sudo $EDITOR /etc/apt/sources.list

To list all the missing firmware run the following command

	# sudo dmesg | grep 'firmware: failed to load'

To search for the appropriate packages we use apt-file.
We first need to install it and update it

	# sudo apt install apt-file
	# sudo apt-file update

Then we can find our missing firmware running

	apt-file find <missing-firmware>
