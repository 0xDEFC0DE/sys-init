WHAT TO DO AFTER A DEBIAN BASIC INSTALL

First we have to add our user to the sudoers group.
We have to first log as root running

Log as root runnning

	# su root

then install sudo and add our user to the sudoers group

	# apt install sudo
	# adduser $USER sudo

We can then log back into our user running

	# su $USER

In order to have a graphical environment, we install X.org running

	# sudo apt install xorg

Instead of installing a desktop environment, we will install a window manager.
There are countless window managers, one of the most prominent is i3.
instead of using i3 we will install dwm.
Since to configure this window manager we have to recompile it, we need to
download the source code.
To do that we use git

	# sudo apt install git

now we can download the dwm official repository from suckless

	# mkdir -p ~/docs/repos
	# cd ~/docs/repos
	# git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm

Now we have a dwm directory in our repos folder.
We now cd into our dwm source directory

	# cd dwm

We then install the needed dependencies for dwm

	# sudo apt install make gcc libx11-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev

Nothing else should be missing, we can compile dwm with

	# sudo make clean install

We have to set things up in a way that dwm is started whenever we start
our xserver.
To do so we make a file called .xinitrc in our home directory.

	# cd ~
	# echo exec dwm >> .xinitrc

Now we need a terminal emulator to use when we start our window manager.
I like suckless software, for this reason we will use st, the simple terminal.
Like dwm, we download and compile the source code

	# cd ~/docs/repos
	# git clone https://git.suckless.org/st
	# cd st
	# sudo make clean install

We also install the menu bar used by dwm, which is dmenu.

	# cd ~/docs/repos
	# git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
	# cd dmenu
	# sudo make clean install

Now we have to set up the software component that will handle our network
connections.
In this case we use network-manager.

	# sudo apt install network-manager

For power management we use tlp.

	# sudo apt install tlp

We use pulseaudio for our sound server and load default configuration

	# sudo apt install pulseaudio pavucontrol pulseaudio-utils
	# cd ~
	# mkdir -p .config/pulse
	# cp /etc/pulse/client.conf ~/.config/pulse/

To monitor our system we use htop and conky

	# sudo apt install htop conky

We also need to install fonts to use.
I use linux-libertine and inconsolata.

	# sudo apt install fonts-linuxlibertine fonts-inconsolata

We now install a web browser, always useful.
My browser of choice is still firefox.

	# sudo apt install firefox-esr

To start the xserver we use the command

	# startx
